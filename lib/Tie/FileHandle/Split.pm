=head1 NAME

Tie::FileHandle::Split - Filehandle tie that captures, splits and stores output into files in a given path.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.94

$VERSION = 0.94;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module, when tied to a filehandle, will capture and store all that
is output to that handle. You should then select a path to store files and a
size to split files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # $path should exist or the current process have enough priv. for creation.
 # $size should be > 0.
 tie *HANDLE, 'Tie::FileHandle::Split', $path, $size;

 # Register code to listen to file creation
 (tied *HANDLE)->add_file_creation_listeners( sub {
	my ( $tied_object, $filename) = @_;
	print "Created $filename with size: " . -s $filename . "\n";
 } );

 # Will create int( $many_times_size / $split_size) files of size $split_size.
 # Will call each listener int( $many_times_size / $split_size) times.
 # Buffers will hold $many_times_size % $split_size outstanding bytes.
 (tied *HANDLE)->print( ' ' x $many_times_size );

 # Write all outstanding output from buffers to files.
 # The last file created can be smaller than split_size
 (tied *HANDLE)->write_buffers;

 # Get generated filenames to the moment
 (tied *HANDLE)->get_filenames();

=head1 METHODS

=head3 C<write_buffers>

C<write_buffers> writes all outstanding buffers to files.
It is automatically called before destroying the object to ensure all data
written to the tied filehandle is written to files. If additional data is
written to the filehandle after a call to C<write_buffers> a new file will be
created. On a standard file split operation it is called after writting all data
to the tied file handle ensure the last bit of data is written (in the most
common case where data size is not exactly divisible by the split size).

=cut

sub write_buffers {
	# Must implement
	my ( $self ) = @_;

	# this should not happen...
	$self->_write_files( $self->{split_size} );
	if ( $self->{buffer_size} > 0 ) {
		$self->_write_files( $self->{buffer_size} );
	}
}

=head3 C<get_filenames>

C<get_filenames> returns a list of the files generates until the moment of the
call. It should be used to get the names of files and rename them to the
desired filenames. In a standard splitting operation C<get_filenames> is
called after outputting all data to the filehandle and calling C<write_buffers>.

=cut

# Returns filenames generated up to the moment the method is called
sub get_filenames {
	my ( $self ) = @_;

	return @{$self->{filenames}} if defined $self->{filenames};
}

=head3 C<add_file_creation_listeners>

C<add_file_creation_listeners> adds methods to the list of listeners of the
file creation event. Methods should be code, array, arrayref or any
non-recursive structure resulting from them. Since methods are added to a HASH,
several elements pointing to the same piece of code will be added only once.
Code observing this event is called once per file created of the $split_size
size defined in the tie clause. When called the Tie::FileHandle::Split object
and the complete path to the newly created file is passed as parameter. The file
is of the specified C<$split_size> defined in the tie clause unless generated
from a C<write_buffers> call, has been closed and an effort has been made for it
to sync (untested).

}

=head3 C<remove_file_creation_listeners>

C<remove_file_creation_listeners> removes a list of methods from the list of
listeners of the file creation event. Methods should be code, array, arrayref or
any non-recursive structure resulting from them.

=head3 C<clear_file_creation_listeners>

C<clear_file_creation_listeners> removes all methods from the list of listeners
of the file creation event.

=over 4

=item * Very untested for anything other than writing to the filehandle.

=item * write_buffers should sync to disk, untested and seeking advice.
